The parts needed to build this keyboard are:
* PCBs made from Gerber files supplied - I used JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com), and the TH_XIAO zip file, which currently costs around $10 for five units plus shipping.
* Seeeduino XIAO modules (https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) which I purchase in packs of three from Amazon for $21.99 (https://www.amazon.com/Seeeduino-Smallest-Microcontroller-Interfaces-Compatible/dp/B08745JBRP)
* 30 Kailh Choc Switches, available in many types
* 30 Choc Keycaps
* 30 1N4148 SMD Diodes (Part number to come)
* 3D Printed Case
* USB-C Cable (with small USB-C end to fit between switches)

<Information on switch types and caps sources to come>
